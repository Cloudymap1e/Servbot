# Debugging Improvements to CLI

## Changes Made

### Enhanced `inbox` Command

The `inbox` command now shows:

1. **Message Count**: How many total messages were fetched (and how many are new)
2. **Recent Messages List**: Shows the 10 most recent emails with:
   - Subject
   - From address
   - Date
   - Preview of content (first 80 characters)
3. **Verification Detection Status**: Clear explanation if codes weren't found
4. **Helpful Hints**: Suggests possible reasons why codes weren't detected

### Before:
```
servbot> inbox user@outlook.com
Fetching inbox for user@outlook.com...
Connecting to outlook.office365.com...
No verification codes found in recent emails.
```

### After:
```
servbot> inbox user@outlook.com
Fetching inbox for user@outlook.com...
Connecting to outlook.office365.com...

Fetched 5 total messages (1 new)

## How to Use

Now when you run:

```
servbot> inbox fgmzknbmmt7648@outlook.com
```

You will see:
- Exactly how many messages are in the inbox
- Subject and sender of each recent message
- Whether verification codes were found
- If no codes found, helpful debugging hints

This will help you:
1. **Confirm emails arrived** - You'll see the message subjects
2. **Check timing** - See when emails arrived
3. **Diagnose parsing** - See message previews to check if codes are present
4. **Identify issues** - Get hints about what might be wrong

## Testing the Fix

1. **Restart the CLI** (if already running, type `exit` then start again):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Try the inbox command again**:
   ```
   servbot> inbox fgmzknbmmt7648@outlook.com
   ```

3. **You should now see**:
   - List of messages fetched
   - Message subjects and senders
   - Whether the Reddit email is there
   - If code was detected or why it wasn't

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Email Not Arrived Yet
```

1. Welcome to Outlook
   From: microsoft@outlook.com
   ...

======================================================================
NO VERIFICATION CODES DETECTED
======================================================================

Messages were fetched but no verification codes were found.
This could mean:
  1. The verification email hasn't arrived yet
  2. The code pattern isn't recognized
  3. The email is in a different folder
```

**Action**: Wait a bit, then try `inbox` again.

### Scenario 2: Email Arrived But Code Not Detected
```
Fetched 3 total messages (1 new)

======================================================================
NO VERIFICATION CODES DETECTED
======================================================================

Messages were fetched but no verification codes were found.
This could mean:
  1. The verification email hasn't arrived yet
  2. The code pattern isn't recognized (check message preview above)
  3. The email is in a different folder
```

**Action**: The email is there but code wasn't extracted. This means the pattern needs adjustment. Report the message preview to debug further.
