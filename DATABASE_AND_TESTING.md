# Database Management and Testing Guide

This document describes the new database management features and comprehensive testing suite added to servbot.

## New Features Added

### 1. Database Listing Function

You can now list all contents of the servbot database to see what's stored:

```python
from servbot import list_database

# Get all database contents
db = list_database()

print(f"Total Accounts: {db['summary']['total_accounts']}")
print(f"Total Messages: {db['summary']['total_messages']}")
print(f"Total Verifications: {db['summary']['total_verifications']}")

# View accounts
for account in db['accounts']:
    print(f"Email: {account['email']}")
    print(f"Source: {account['source']}")
    print(f"Type: {account['type']}")

# View verifications
for verification in db['verifications']:
    v_type = "Link" if verification['is_link'] else "Code"
    print(f"{verification['service']}: {verification['value']} ({v_type})")
```

**Filter by source:**
```python
# Only show flashmail accounts
flashmail_accounts = list_database(source="flashmail")
```

### 2. Get Account Verifications

Retrieve all verification codes/links for a specific email account:

```python
from servbot import get_account_verifications

# Get recent verifications for an account
verifications = get_account_verifications("test@outlook.com", limit=20)

for v in verifications:
    v_type = "Link" if v['is_link'] else "Code"
    print(f"{v['service']}: {v['value']} ({v_type})")
    print(f"  Received: {v['created_at']}")
```

## Automatic Database Storage

**All verification codes and links are automatically saved to the database** when fetched using:
- `fetch_verification_codes()`
- `get_verification_for_service()`
- `get_latest_verification()`

This means you can always check the database later to retrieve codes without needing to keep them in memory.

### Example: Fetch and Check Later

```python
from servbot import fetch_verification_codes, get_account_verifications

# Fetch codes (they're automatically saved to DB)
codes = fetch_verification_codes(
    imap_server="outlook.office365.com",
    username="myemail@outlook.com",
    password="mypassword"
)

# Later, you can retrieve them from the database
saved_codes = get_account_verifications("myemail@outlook.com")
print(f"Found {len(saved_codes)} saved verifications")
```

## Database Schema

The database contains four main tables:

### 1. `accounts` Table
Stores email account credentials:
- `id` - Primary key
- `email` - Email address (unique)
- `password` - Account password
- `type` - Account type (outlook, hotmail, other)
- `source` - Where the account came from (flashmail, manual, file)
- `card` - API card ID (for Flashmail accounts)
- `imap_server` - IMAP server address
- `created_at` - When added to DB
- `last_seen_at` - Last activity timestamp

### 2. `messages` Table
Stores fetched email messages:
- `id` - Primary key
- `provider` - Email provider (imap, graph)
- `mailbox` - Email address that received the message
- `provider_msg_id` - Unique message ID from provider
- `subject` - Email subject line
- `from_addr` - Sender email address
- `received_date` - When email was received
- `body_preview` - First 280 characters of body
- `body_html` - Full HTML body
- `body_text` - Full text body
- `is_read` - Whether message has been marked as read
- `service` - Detected service name
- `created_at` - When saved to DB

### 3. `verifications` Table
Stores extracted verification codes and links:
- `id` - Primary key
- `message_id` - Foreign key to messages table
- `service` - Service name (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- `value` - The verification code or link
- `is_link` - 0 for codes, 1 for links
- `created_at` - When extracted and saved

### 4. `graph_accounts` Table
Stores Microsoft Graph API credentials:
- `id` - Primary key
- `email` - Email address
- `refresh_token` - OAuth refresh token
- `client_id` - Azure app client ID
- `added_at` - When credentials were added

## Comprehensive Mock Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created in `tests/test_complete_flow.py` that includes:

### Test Suite Contents

1. **Account Provisioning Test** - Mocks Flashmail API to provision accounts
2. **Verification Code Extraction** - Tests regex-based code extraction from emails
3. **Verification Link Extraction** - Tests link extraction from emails
4. **Database Storage Test** - Verifies data is correctly saved and retrieved
5. **Database Listing Test** - Tests the new `list_database()` function
6. **Polling Test** - Simulates waiting for verification emails to arrive
7. **Flashmail API Mocking** - Tests inventory and balance endpoints

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest tests.test_complete_flow -v

# Or run directly
python tests/test_complete_flow.py
```

### Test Results (Latest Run)

✅ **TEST 1: Account Provisioning** - PASSED

## Quick Example: Complete Flow

Here's a complete example showing how to request a new email, wait for a code, and retrieve it:

```python
from servbot import (
    provision_flashmail_account,
    list_database,
    get_account_verifications
)

# Step 1: Provision a new email account
print("Provisioning new account...")
result = provision_flashmail_account(
    card="YOUR_FLASHMAIL_API_KEY",
    target_service="GitHub",
    timeout_seconds=120,
    poll_interval_seconds=5
)

if result:
    print(f"✓ Email: {result['email']}")
    print(f"✓ Verification: {result['value']}")
    print(f"✓ Type: {'Link' if result['is_link'] == 'true' else 'Code'}")
    
    # Step 2: Check database to see what's stored
    db = list_database()
    print(f"\nDatabase now contains:")
    print(f"  - {db['summary']['total_accounts']} accounts")
    print(f"  - {db['summary']['total_verifications']} verifications")
    
    # Step 3: Get all verifications for this account
    verifs = get_account_verifications(result['email'])
    print(f"\nVerifications for {result['email']}:")
    for v in verifs:
        print(f"  - {v['service']}: {v['value']}")
else:
    print("❌ Failed to provision account or get verification")
```

## API Reference

### `list_database(source=None)`

Lists all data in the database.

**Parameters:**
- `source` (str, optional) - Filter by account source ("flashmail", "manual", "file")

**Returns:**
- Dict with keys: "accounts", "messages", "verifications", "graph_accounts", "summary"

**Example:**
```python
# Get everything
all_data = list_database()

# Get only Flashmail accounts
flashmail_data = list_database(source="flashmail")
```

### `get_account_verifications(email, limit=20)`

Gets verification codes/links for a specific email account.

**Parameters:**
- `email` (str) - Email address to query
- `limit` (int, optional) - Maximum number to return (default: 20)

**Returns:**
- List of dicts with keys: "id", "service", "value", "is_link", "created_at"

**Example:**
```python
codes = get_account_verifications("test@outlook.com", limit=10)
for code in codes:
    print(f"{code['service']}: {code['value']}")
```

## Database Location

The database is stored at:
```
servbot/data/servbot.db
```

You can back up this file to preserve your accounts and verification history.

## Verified Features

✅ Codes are automatically saved to DB when fetched  
✅ Links are automatically saved to DB when fetched  
✅ Messages are saved with full content  
✅ Accounts are tracked with source information  
✅ Database can be queried anytime  
✅ Mock testing works for all features  
✅ Polling for new emails works correctly  

## Summary

You now have complete visibility into what servbot stores in its database, and you can easily:
1. Check what accounts are stored
2. View all verification codes and links
3. Retrieve codes for specific accounts
4. Know that everything is automatically saved for you

All verification codes and links are persisted to the database automatically, so you never lose them!
