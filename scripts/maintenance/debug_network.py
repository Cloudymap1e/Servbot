If you see the same IP (especially 198.18.x.x) for multiple different servers,
this indicates DNS hijacking or a transparent proxy is intercepting your traffic.

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. VPN software redirecting traffic
2. Corporate/school network with content filtering
3. Antivirus software with "HTTPS scanning" enabled
4. Firewall blocking IMAP/SSL traffic
5. ISP-level filtering or proxy

SOLUTIONS TO TRY:
1. Disable VPN temporarily and retry
2. Disable antivirus "HTTPS scanning" or "SSL inspection"
3. Try from a different network (mobile hotspot, different WiFi)
4. Check Windows Firewall settings
5. Check if there's a proxy configured in Windows (Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy)
6. Try using a different DNS server (e.g., Google DNS: 8.8.8.8)
